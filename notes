We used a multiple Ring model with a total of 131,072 cells comprising
10,878,976 nodes running for 10 ms on NVIDIA K20X GPU (NVIDIA
Corporation, 2012)
 Every cell has the same number (83) of nodes
but different cell types
have a different random branching pattern of the 40 dendrites.  The
number of identical cells per type ranges from 1 (131,072 distinct
branching patterns) to 32 (4096 distinct branching patterns). 

Adjacent '.' means that parent nodes are adjacent.  An 'o' means the
memory location of the parent is not adjacent to the previous parent
access.  The last graph shows the parent memory access pattern for three
cells, each with a different tree topology (each tree has same number of
compartments).  Now X means there is nothing for that core to compute. 
R and r both mean two children are adding something to the parent so
have to do it atomically.  R is otherwis equivalent to o and 'r' is
otherwise equivalent to '.' Often times an X is required to avoid
vicious race conditions where otherwise a child would add to a parent at
the same time that parent was adding to its parent. 

8 topologies of 4 cells each. Adjacent '.' means that parent nodes are adjacent.
An 'o' means the memory location of the parent is not adjacent to the
previous parent access.
